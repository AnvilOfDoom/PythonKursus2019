"""8-7. Album
Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album. The function should take in an
 artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information. Use the
  function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. Print each return value to show that
  the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly.

Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the nubmer of tracks on an album. If the
calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary.
Make at least one new function call that includes the nubmer of tracks on an album."""
