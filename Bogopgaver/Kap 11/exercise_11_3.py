""""11-3: Employee
Write a class called Employee.
The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name,
and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes.
Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the annual salary by default
but also accepts a different raise amount.

Write a test case for Employee.
Write two test methods, test_give_default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise().
Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance in each test method.
Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass."""
