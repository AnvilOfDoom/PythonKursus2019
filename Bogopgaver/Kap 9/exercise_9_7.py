"""9-7. Admin
An administrator is a special kind of user.
Write a class called Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 166)
or Exercise 9-5 (page 171).
Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list of strings like
"can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on.
WRite a method called show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of privileges.
Create an instance of Admin, and call your method."""
